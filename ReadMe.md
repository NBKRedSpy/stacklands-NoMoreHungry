# Description

As the name suggests, this mod will allow you to enjoy your community without worrying about its food supply!

Set villagers to require no food or only one food each!

# Settings

|--|--|--|
|Max Food Requirement|0|The maximum amount of food a villager will require. Set to zero to not require food. The base game normally requires up to two food per villager.|
|Emulate Feeding|true|If using zero for required food (no food required), this mod will emulate feeding which allows villagers to heal. This should remain on and is available only in case there is a bug in the feeding functionality.|

# Change Log

## 2.2.0

* Fix:  Villagers not healing when required food is set to zero.
The change emulates the non food part of the "feeding" cycle to heal and handle other clean up processes previously skipped.

Thanks to Steam user DreeseDatalink for reporting this issue.
