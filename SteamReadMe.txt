As the name suggests, this mod will allow you to enjoy your community without worrying about its food supply!

Set villagers to require no food or only one food each!


[h1]Settings[/h1]

[b]Max Food Requirement[/b]
The maximum amount of food a villager will require.  By default the game uses two food per villager.  Set to zero to not require food or one to require one food per villager.
The mod's default is zero (no food required).

Values higher than two won't be needed unless a mod or later DLC adds a unit that requires three or more food.
